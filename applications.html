there is alot of applications but I will give the most common uses
AI in marketing:
Marketing is a way to sugar coat your products to attract more customers.
We, humans, are pretty good at sugar coating, but what if an algorithm or a bot is built solely for the purpose of marketing a brand or a company?
It would do a pretty awesome job!
In the early 2000s, if we searched an online store to find a product without knowing it’s exact name, it would become a nightmare to find the product.
But now when we search for an item on any e-commerce store, we get all possible results related to the item.
It’s like these search engines read our minds! In a matter of seconds, we get a list of all relevant items. An example of this is finding the right movies on Netflix.
AI in gaming:
Over the past few years, Artificial Intelligence has become an integral part of the gaming industry. In fact, one of the biggest accomplishments of AI is in the gaming industry.
DeepMind’s AI-based AlphaGo software, which is known for defeating Lee Sedol, the world champion in the game of GO,
is considered to be one of the most significant accomplishment in the field of AI.
Shortly after the victory, DeepMind created an advanced version of AlphaGo called AlphaGo Zero which defeated the predecessor in an AI-AI face off.
Unlike the original AlphaGo, which DeepMind trained over time by using a large amount of data and supervision,
the advanced system, AlphaGo Zero taught itself to master the game.
Other examples of Artificial Intelligence in gaming include the First Encounter Assault Recon, popularly known as F.E.A.R,
which is a first-person shooter video game.
AI in health care:
When it comes to saving our lives, a lot of organizations and medical care centers are relying on AI.
There are many examples of how AI in healthcare has helped patients all over the world.
An organization called Cambio Health Care developed a clinical decision support system for stroke prevention that can give the physician a warning when
there’s a patient at risk of having a heart stroke. now i will mention the pros and cons.
