Nest was one of the most famous and successful artificial intelligence startups and it was acquired by Google in 2014 for $3.2 billion.
The Nest Learning Thermostat uses behavioral algorithms to save energy based on your behavior and schedule.
It employs a very intelligent machine learning process that learns the temperature you like and programs itself in about a week. 
Moreover, it will automatically turn off to save energy, if nobody is at home.
In fact, it is a combination of both  artificial intelligence as well as Bluetooth low-energy because some components of this solution will use BLE services and solutions.
