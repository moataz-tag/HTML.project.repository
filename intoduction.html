Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks
that typically require human intelligence.
AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning 
and deep learning are creating a paradigm 
shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.
All but the simplest human behaviour is ascribed to intelligence, while even the most complicated insect behaviour is never taken as an indication
of intelligence. What is the difference? Consider the behaviour of the digger wasp, Sphex ichneumoneus.
When the female wasp returns to her burrow with food, she first deposits it on the threshold, checks for intruders inside her burrow,
and only then, if the coast is clear, carries her food inside. The real nature of the wasp s instinctual behaviour is revealed if the food is moved
a few inches away from the entrance to her burrow while she is inside: on emerging, she will repeat the whole procedure as often as the food is displaced.
Intelligence conspicuously absent in the case of Sphex must include the ability to adapt to new circumstances.
Psychologists generally do not characterize human intelligence by just one trait but by the combination of many diverse abilities.
Research in AI has focused chiefly on the following components of intelligence: learning, reasoning, problem solving, perception, and using language. 
There are four types of artificial intelligence: reactive machines, limited memory, theory of mind and self-awareness.
